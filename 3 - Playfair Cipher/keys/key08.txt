A T H E L
I _ Y Q _

S V R M P
X _ W N F

Explanation:

I found 

BTHEYHADNTMETLPRSEVERALYEAR

I think it's supposed to be

THEY HADNT MET FOR SEVERAL YEAR

So LP is FO, so either

A T H E L
I _ Y Q _
_ _ K D O
S V R M P
X _ W N F

or

A T H E L
I _ Y Q O
_ _ K D P
S V R M _
X _ W N F

But when I try the first one, the first few plaintext characters 
are MR AND MRS. So I think the first one is correct.
