Explanation:

I think it would be useful to find the last character in the '_THEL' row.
There are two candidate: A and I. Why? Because ?T bigrams would be encrypted
to TH with 0.96% frequency. Both AT and IT has high frequency.

A is chosen because both IT and TI has high frequency, but in the ciphertext,
TH has high frequency and HT has low frequency. That fits with AT and TA.
